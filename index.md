# Topographic Differencing 

We provide material including several video tutoials, blog posts with multiple differencing examples, links to GitHub code respositories, material presented at workshops, and undergraduate differencing exercise.

## Blog Posts: 
These blog posts show several examples of vertical and 3D topographic differencing. The 3D differencing blog also includes a technical overview of how the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is applied to geologic processes.
